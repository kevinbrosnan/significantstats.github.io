I am a passionate developer of statistical techniques to address real life problems. I have completed a B.Sc in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Limerick, with a major in Statistics. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the University of Limerick with my thesis titled ''Statistical Modelling of Flow Cytometry with inclusion of key biological knowledge''. I have also worked recently on statistical applications in Sports Science.

I also have experience in Management Consultancy (Accenture), Banking (AIB) and developing analytic tools for multinational companies (Accenture).

I am or have been a teaching assistant for the following courses at the University of Limerick:

- MA4003: An introduction to Laplace Transforms, Fourier Series, and their use in solving Ordinary Differential Equations. In addition an overview of the theory and methods of Linear Algebra and the numerical processes used in solving Linear Algebra problems, and their extension to some nonlinear problems was also covered.
- MA4004: A module which establishes an understanding of the fundamentals of probability and its relation to statistics. The course develops statistical inference through the concepts of estimation and hypothesis testing and the application of these concepts to problems from both daily life and engineering/science.
- MA4007: A module which focuses on the theory and applications of experimental design. ANOVA, factorial designs and fractional factorial designs are discussed and their applications to design of experiments is explored.  
- MS4035: The intention of this module is to firmly establish the connections between probability theory and its role in statistical applications. Joint distributions, expectation, estimation and simulation provide the students with an overall understanding of the concept of probability.

I have also provided additional support tutoring to students of the following modules at the University of Limerick:

- MA4004: A module which establishes an understanding of the fundamentals of probability and its relation to statistics. The course develops statistical inference through the concepts of estimation and hypothesis testing and the application of these concepts to problems from both daily life and engineering/science.
- MA4603: A course focused on the fundamental ideas of uncertainty through probability. An introduction to the most widely used statistical distributions and applications thereof. Statistical inference is introduced through the concepts of estimation and hypothesis testing, through a modern statistical software package (e.g. MINITAB), motivated through the analysis of real data and case studies.
